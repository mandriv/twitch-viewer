Just fiddling around with JSON calls, jQuery possibilities, dynamic content creation, a little bit of Bootstrap. I will try to make it more mobile-friendly and fully responsive in the future.

This website was created as a part of [FreeCodeCamp] (freecodecamp.com) challange *Use the Twitchtv JSON API*.

You can find the specification of the challange here: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api
